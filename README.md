The instances provided in this depository are the instances used in the article "Optimizing 3D container loading problem based on a hybrid multi-objective algorithm with multi-drop constraints". 
The file name "generated_data.csv" is used for experiments "with" and "without" multi-drop constraint as shown in Table 5 and Table 6. 
While the results obtained with "3_box_type.csv","5_box_type.csv", "8_box_type.csv", and "10_box_type.csv" are reported in Table 7     
For the comparison analysis, we used the dataset is in the text file format. The instances are named BR1.txt to BR7.txt. The results of this solution is reported in Table 9
Table 8 uses the same data used for the result presented in Tables 5 and 6
